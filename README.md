## Games with C++ and SDL2
The following games were developed using C++ and SDL2. Some aspects like the rotations, collision system, raycast and the common shapes (triangles, circles, etc.) were created from scratch with only the functions to create lines and drawing provided by SDL2. Each of them has a quick demostration video and the source code can be found in the next repository: https://github.com/Vorticalmetal4/ProyectosErick.
